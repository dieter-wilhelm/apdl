The GNU-Emacs major mode for the programming language APDL

APDL (Ansys Parametric Design Language) is the solver scripting
language of the FEA (Finite Element Analysis) suite Ansys (ANalysis
SYStem, registered TM https://www.ansys.com).

The APDL package (formerly APDL-Mode) represents, in conjunction with
the GNU-Emacs editor, an advanced APDL environment with features like
keyword completion, code templates, solver communication (GNU-Linux
only), license reporting, dedicated keybindings, etc.

------------------------------
First usage:

Please type `M-x apdl' to open an Emacs window (aka. buffer) under
APDL-Mode.  From this buffer you can investigate the menu entries
`APDL' and `MAPDL' and trying some APDL code.  E.g. typing `aplot' and
the shortcut `C-c C-b' Emacs is immediately opening its Ansys MAPDL
documentation in a Browser!

Further help you will will find with typing `C-c C-h' including an
introductory tutorial.
