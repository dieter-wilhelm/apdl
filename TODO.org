APDL package to do list
* Priorities
1) Check Github source package with package-install-from-file/buffer
   - apdl-24.0.1.tar.gz
   - It seems that package.el is reading the apdl-readme.txt?!
2) How to place release comments (currently only git logs, NEWS.org?)
3) Texinfo
   - .info binary in repo?
4) Melpa
   - standards
   - where's my recipe?
   - <NAME>-pgk.el -> <NAME>.el for summary line and headers

* Work
- Gnu coding standards https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/
- Makefile conventions? (Magit example)
- TAGS for emacs replacing version strings
- Elisp checks: https://drewsh.com/emacs-package-github-workflow

* Texinfo
We do not need a directory file "dir", we have to place the
apdl.info/apdl.texi (see Melpa build scripts) file in the apdl content
folder.

* Melpa
- Melpa is supposed to build info files from .texi files?
** recipie
melpa/apdl

* Release proceedures
- tagging e.g. "v25.0.0" creates a release
- lightweight tag or with annotation?
